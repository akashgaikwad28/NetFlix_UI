# Neteflex Project

This is a simple frontend project . I built this project with the help of YOUTUB tutorial using HTML and CSS while learning how to think and approach frontend development.

The project includes:

- A responsive HTML layout with sections for featured content, FAQs, and footer links.
- Styling provided by an external CSS file (`style.css`).
- Use of images and videos to enhance the visual appeal.
